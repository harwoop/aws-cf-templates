Singapore VPC to-do:


For PH:
- Test replacing old CentOS AMI with your new one in the CF template, remove redudant instance userdata
- Add App Server build to CF template (that just creates a blank CentOS7 instance), ensure ELBs can see the App Server & you can ssh to App Server via the Bastion
- Update Marval ticket 138257, handover to Ivan (cc Mardell) as per below comments

For II:
- Turn the blank CentOS7 into a fully patched Joomla server (using latest version of Joomla), then create an AMI from that Joomla server

- Acquire SSL cert for cambridge.org.sg, use this to create HTTPS config on the ELB (if Mardell says https required)
- Copy files across from old server (after they are scanned for any viruses)
- Liaise with PH/AP to provide sftp access to new Joomla server for Singapore Marketing users 
	(e.g. we could allow port 22 via the ELB from the Singapore office)

For AP:
- Update the App Server section of the CF template to use the Joomla AMI
- Update the AppLoadBalancer section in the CF template, adding in HTTPS config using the cambridge.org.sg SSL cert (if https required)
- Look at creating a cup-infra S3 bucket (to store stuff that's copied to instances via the CF userdata)
	rather than having an S3 bucket per project
